## What is this project?

This project implements a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for customer support. It uses Python, LangChain, and LangGraph to create a conversational AI that can assist with various travel-related queries, including flight bookings, car rentals, hotel reservations, and excursions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API Key
- LangSmith API Key (optional, for tracing)

## How to run?

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Create a `.env` file from `.dev.env`:
```bash
cp .dev.env .env
```


3. Edit the `.env` file and fill in the required values:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your_langsmith_api_key" # Optional
```


4. Install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```


5. Generate embeddings:

```bash
poetry run python vectorizer/app/main.py
```


6. Start the Qdrant vector database:

```bash
docker compose up qdrant -d
```


   You can access the Qdrant UI at: http://localhost:6333/dashboard#

7. Run the customer support chat system:

```bash
poetry run python ./customer_support_chat/app/main.py
```

## Project Structure

This project consists of two main services:

1. **Vectorizer**: Generates embeddings for the knowledge base.
2. **Customer Support Chat**: The main conversational AI system.

The Customer Support Chat service depends on the vector database generated by the Vectorizer.

## Data Source

This project uses a travel database benchmark from LangGraph. The database schema is as follows:
